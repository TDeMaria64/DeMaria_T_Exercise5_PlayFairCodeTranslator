This is a simple desktop app meant to utilize the PlayFair coded message generation system.
When run, a key is entered in the top field and that will be the keyword that the code is based on.
This keyword must be in all capital letters or the app will not process it. A warning message will display in this case.
The user enters in a message they want to have coded, then they press the "Translate" button at the bottom of the window.
The message will appear in the lower box in its scrambled state.
If the user takes the coded text and feeds it back into the app using teh same keyword, it will unscramble the message.
